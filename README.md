# Overview

Created by Leonie, Georgia, Andy and Tony this is the first project from Founders and Coders Week 1. 

We were tasked with designing and building a one-page portfolio website for our team, 
the site can be accesed ![here](https://fac-17.github.io/MNOP/)

# Purpose:
 - Practice working with github 
 - Practice setting up a website in a team using html, CSS and basic JavaScript 
 - Apply/Consider Nielsen's Usability Heuristics
 - Consider and apply accessibility guidelines
 - Use regular expressions
 
# Goals:
  - Have a one page website that meets all of the requirements, as listed in [here.](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-1/project.md)
 - Mobile first design
 
 # Stretch goals:
 - Email checker with second email confirmation input to ensure match
 - 3 distinct media queries with different cropped images for screen sizes.
 - Have some cool javascript
 - Use the pattern attribute to run regex validations against input values in password field of the form
(We didn't get to any of these stretch goals ðŸ˜”)

## Inspiration and ideas

- Name. Light, bulb, lux, seed, pip, light bold, flash, spark, luma, lit!
- 

We started by looking at similar sites in order to pick out common design themes:

This is a link to [Design Agency's website.](https://www.designagency.co.uk/about#)
Link to [Matthew Williams site](http://findmatthew.com/) Moving background image example 
[Josue Espinosa site](http://ejosue.com/) More big background images
 
We dediced on the following page elememts: 
1. Company Name + Headline 
2. Nav Bar with 'About, Team, and Contact'
3. Contact form with my name, email and message information
 
And we knew we would need the following: 
1. A website name
2. One page
3. Images of us
4. Burger (top right hand side)
5. Logo (top left)
6. Sticky navigation bar? ![We looked into the pros and cons of this](https://www.awwwards.com/fixed-navigation-bars-pros-and-cons.html)


### Name & tagline

We looked into various names including: Light, bulb, lux, seed, pip, light bold, flash, spark, luma, lit!
And we settled on
Lit!
With the following tagline:

'The industry's brightest new developers. Shining a light on creative web design. Illuminating your online presence.

Brightening up the web with illuminating designs. Lit! for shining a light on 

Illuminating websites from the brightest minds.'

Our original plan was as follows:

#### Day 1
Planning 
Create a repo 
Finish Wireframe 
Create HTML & CSS 

#### Day 2
Add Javascript 
Optimize Accessibilty 
Add design elements 


### Approach 
- Mobile-first 
- no divs 

We ended up not getting to the Javascript on the second day, though as the site needed to be accessible without this, this wasn't that much of an issue.
