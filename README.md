# Overview

Created by Leonie, Georgia, Andy and Tony this is the first project from Founders and Coders Week 1. 

We were tasked with designing and building a one-page portfolio website for our team, 
the site can be accesed ![here](https://fac-17.github.io/MNOP/)

# Purpose:
 - Practice working with github 
 - Practice setting up a website in a team using html, CSS and basic JavaScript 
 - Apply/Consider Nielsen's Usability Heuristics
 - Consider and apply accessibility guidelines
 - Use regular expressions for email checker
 
# Goals:
  - Have a one page website that meets all of the requirements, as listed [here.](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-1/project.md)
 - Mobile first design
 
 # Stretch goals:
 - Email checker with second email confirmation input to ensure match
 - 3 distinct media queries with different cropped images for screen sizes.
 - Have some cool javascript
 - Use the pattern attribute to run regex validations against input values in password field of the form
(We didn't get to any of these stretch goals ðŸ˜”)

# Inspiration and ideas

We started by looking at similar sites in order to pick out common design themes:

This is a link to [Design Agency's website.](https://www.designagency.co.uk/about#)
Link to [Matthew Williams site](http://findmatthew.com/) Moving background image example 
[Josue Espinosa site](http://ejosue.com/) More big background images
 
We dediced on the following page elememts: 
1. Company Name + Headline 
2. Nav Bar with 'About, Team, and Contact'
3. Contact form with my name, email and message information
 
And we knew we would need the following: 
1. A website name
2. One page
3. Images of us
4. Burger (top right hand side)
5. Logo (top left)
6. Sticky navigation bar? ![We looked into the pros and cons of this](https://www.awwwards.com/fixed-navigation-bars-pros-and-cons.html)


# Name & tagline

We looked into various names including: Light, bulb, lux, seed, pip, light bold, flash, spark, luma, lit!
And we settled on
Lit!
With the following tagline:

'The industry's brightest new developers. Shining a light on creative web design. Illuminating your online presence.

Brightening up the web with illuminating designs. Lit! for shining a light on 

Illuminating websites from the brightest minds.'

Our original plan was as follows:

#### Day 1
Planning 
Create a repo 
Finish Wireframe 
Create HTML & CSS 

#### Day 2
Add Javascript 
Optimize Accessibilty 
Add design elements 

### Approach 
- Mobile-first 
- no divs 

We ended up not getting to the Javascript on the second day, though as the site needed to be accessible without this, this wasn't that much of an issue. Otherwise things went mostly to plan, it took longer to style than we expected as there were conflicts to resolve within git and we had a lot of different screen sizes to account for. In retrospect if we'd had more time we could have added another media query to make life easier for us.

# Design

## Branding
funky, upbeat, colorful, bold, unconventional, innovation

## Fonts
Barricieto 
Roboto
Futura
Lobster


## Color Theme 
Non-photo blue #9FD7F2 (Pulled from the image we chose as our main image)
Golden-Poppy #FEC500 (Pulled from the image we chose as our main image)
#413F53

## Responsive Design
- Mobile design 375px
- Desktop 480px

 



 ## What went well
 - Division of work between pairs
 - Team getting on well!
 - Clear design and concensus
 - Focussing on delivering a mvp rather than getting bogged down in excess detail
 
 
 ## What we struggled with:
 - github pushes/pulls/merges (though we got better at this)
 - Main image with text overlay, absolute vs relative. 
 - Nav bar going past page width
 
 
 
 ## What we learnt:
 - Using issues for specific things, keeping them specific 
 - Resolving merge conflicts especially when working in the same files
 - We knew we needed to focus on mobile first design. As such we had the default stying set for a screen width of approx 375px and the media query designed to trigger at everything above this. However we completely forgot this several times! We kept making changes to the code outside of the media query and forgetting that this was for the larger screen size rather than the smaller. ðŸ™„
 - Using rem, em, percentage rather than pixels. We started with pixels and had to back and change a lot of things to rems which made life a lot harder. 
- We've learned about a css file called ![normalise](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) that we plan on using in future projects to avoid obvious/simple issues like margins on the body so that we don't have spend time solving these issues. 


## Conclusion

We're very happy with how the project turned out. We had limited time and we're working with new technology in a group which was very differnt for us all, yet our site was functional and satisfied the majority of the user stories.
